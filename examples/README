The files named "kb_*" are sample keyboard definition files, used with the
environment variable "EKBFILE".

The "e_profile" and "e_profile20" files are sample ".e_profile" and
".e_profile20" files, respectively

The "*buttons*" files are sample button definition files for the
"-buttonfile=/path/to/buttonfile" command-line argument, which would
generally be placed in a ".e_profile" file.  The file "e_buttons.demo"
file has examples demonstrating a button definition that allows an
"e" command with arguments ("tg+":<cmd>tag +1<ret>).
