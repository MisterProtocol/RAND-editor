# Shell file to run ctags on the editor source.
# Historically the standard way of commenting a function
# was to put a comment block at the top surrounded by #ifdef COMMENT / #endif.
# Inside the block is a function prototype documenting the purpose and
# arguments of the function.
#
# Unfortunately this format confuses "ctags", which was invented decades later.
# This shell file munges the entirety of the source into a form acceptable
# to ctags, runs ctags on the resulting tree, moves the tags file to the
# e20 directory, and then deletes the temporary tree.
#
# There are duplicate tags in this tree, so ctags is run with the
# "-n" option, opting for line numbers inside the tags
# file and not search strings.  This requires the ctags command to be
# run more often, since search strings allow the tags to move up and
# down in the file while line numbers do not.  However, the format
# with line numbers is the only way to allow duplicate tags, since with
# search strings, all the search strings for duplicates would look the same.
#
# Note that this script requires the "exuberant ctags" or "universal"
# version of ctags. The Mac Developer Tools version is ancient and
# does not support the "-n" option.
