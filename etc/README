Copy the keyboard files to $LIB (typically /usr/local/etc/e).

Usage eg.: 'setenv EKBFILE $LIB/kb.sun'.

kb_ncurses is a sample keyboard file that allows definition of actions for
function keys, e.g. KEY_F2, etc.  Note that this file depends upon code
present in the "ncurses" library which is not supported by the non-mouse
version of the editor, so that if e19 and e20 editors are in simultaneous
use on your system, it is wise to put the keyboard files for the two version
in different places, and use the EKBFILE and EKBFILE_NCURSES environment
variables to keep them in separate places.  e20 will use EKBFILE
if EKBFILE_NCURSES is not set, otherwise it will use EKBFILE_NCURSES.
The non-mouse version of the editor will only use EKBFILE.
