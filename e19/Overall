This file contains overall comments about E.

The 'Comments' file is a compendium of the
comments which precede each routine in the editor.

Further essential documentation is contained in comments preceding
global data declarations in the various '.h' files, especially 'e.h'.

The file State.fmt tells the format of the state file.

The editor calls routines in the LA Package which call the FFIO Package.
These two are I/O subroutine libraries whose source and object are
found in parallel directories whose names are in Makefile.
Modern Version 7 C as described in "The C Programming Language" by
Kernighan and Ritchie is assumed.

All functions which return values are declared with an explicit type.
The types of returns possible from the function are implicit in the
declaration.  For example, functions declared as type 'Cmdret' will
return a value which is a possible command return value.  These are
found in e.cm.h.

In many routines, the argument 'puflg' means do a new putup () when done.
