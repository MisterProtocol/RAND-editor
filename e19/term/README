Terminals- this is what makes E a better editor than EDT. The ability to
run on an adm3, and also a vt100, and make use of the features on both.

There is a lot of stuff in here. Because the terminal drivers change almost
as much as the code, I have made the term directory a subdirectory of the
source directory. I have eliminated some old stuff, left some others.
Some notes about what is left follow.

Philosophy - I have been attempting to suppress the terminal drivers as
much as possible by pressing in two directions: making the termcap output
driver and termcap entries as complete as possible, and bringing up the
general input driver (e.iit.c and e.it.c). The former is further along
than the latter; that accounts for the Termcap files herein for those
terminals which work well with termcap. These should be used in place of
the termcap entries in /etc/termcap. How you do that is up to you.
