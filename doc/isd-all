A new version of E (19) has been installed on the ISL Vaxes and Suns.
Should you encounter any problems, the old version may be accessed by
invoking "e18".


Brief Summary of e19 changes
----------------------------


1.  HELP FACILITY

    Type "<CMD>help" to enter help mode.  In help mode, whenever any
    function key or CTRL sequence is pressed, a message describing the
    function is displayed.  Type a <RETURN> to exit help mode.



2.  WORD PROCESSING MODE

    Two new features are available in WP mode: (a) word wrap, and
    (b) support for a "left margin".

    Type "<CMD>wp" to enter word proc mode, "<CMD>-wp" to exit.
    In this mode, "WP" is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

    a) word wrap

       Text that extends past the right margin is automatically placed
       at the left margin.  The right margin (default = 74) is displayed
       on the right side of the bottom border with a "+", and is set by
       "<CMD>set width nn" (or "<CMD> set rmar nn").

    b) left margin

       The left margin is set by "<CMD>set lmar nn".  Any left
       margin setting is displayed on the left side of the bottom border
       with a "+".  In WP mode, a <RETURN> moves the cursor to the left
       margin, rather then the left edge of the screen.



3.  DELETE WORD

    There is a new command to delete words.  The decision as to where to
    place this key is still being worked on with CSD (for compatibility).
    For now, the sequence "<CTRL-X><CTRL-N>" will work on Ambassadors,
    XLs, Suns, or any terminal using the standard keyboard.
    On the XLs and Suns, "<SHIFT><DEL CHAR>" may also be used.

    This command will delete the word the cursor is on, or the next
    word if the cursor is positioned on 'white space'.


4.  RIGHT MARGIN BEHAVIOR

    The behavior at the right margin has been changed to offer two
    modes.  (1) nostick mode - typing or moving the cursor past the
    rt. margin will automatically shift the window as if the
    <WIN RT> key had been pressed.  (2) stick mode - typing past the
    rt margin will give the "stuck at rt margin" msg, and moving
    the cursor past the rt margin will do nothing (it used to move
    1 space).  The default is nostick mode, which makes sense now that
    word wrap is implemented.  One may use "<cmd>set [no]stick" to
    switch modes, or use the "-stick" argument when envoking E.


5.  GOTO

    The goto command may also be specified as "<CMD>nn" in addition to the
    previous "<CMD>g nn".


6.  -STATE OPTION

    E can be called up with the state file from a previous E session.
    Example:

	% e -state=statefile

    This option causes the initial state of the editor to be read from the
    indicated file.  Thus, a user may create an editor state, with
    alternate files, windows, cursor positioned, etc, etc, and then exit
    from the editor and rename the statefile (usually ".es1") to another
    name.  Subsequent calls upon E with the state option addressing the
    renamed state file will cause the editor to be reset to that state.
    The named file is only used to set up the initial state; it therefore
    will not be subsequently changed by the editor.  This allows the user
    to create canned editor environments containing files, windows, cursor
    positions, etc.


7.  TAB SETTINGS

    Individual tab settings are displayed across the top border with a "+".
