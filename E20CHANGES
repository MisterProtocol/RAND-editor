E20 Changes:

-   Major code cleanup eliminating compiler warnings; bug fixes.

-   New crash recover options, allowing playback to stop early.

-   Revised the state file to include the options to restore an E
    session (eg: "% e <return>") to the same state as when one exited.
    Traditionally, "e" has incremented its version number when the
    state file format has changed; hence, "e" is now "e20".

-   Added mouse support using the left button to move the cursor,
    change windows, and press/drag to mark a rectangular area.  The middle
    button can be used to begin a "mark" and to "unmark" an area.  The
    middle button will also scroll up/down if E20 is compiled with version 6.2
    or greater of the ncurses library.  The right button is not used in E.
    (Tip:  to copy/paste text in and out of E, hold the <SHIFT>key.)

-   Added the following color options for highlighting a marked area:

      -setab=N [0-255] set background color number (black=0, white=255)
      -setaf=N [0-255] set foreground color number (black=0, white=255)
    or
      -bgcolor=r,g,b (background color)
      -fgcolor=r,g,b (foreground color)

    "-setab" and "-setaf" use the ANSI color numbers.
    (Tip:  if you have 256 colors available, background values
    for the -setab option to try are: 3, 7, 11, 117, 151, 178, 194, 195, 222).


-   Brace matching mode, {}, (), []

    In brace matching mode, placing the cursor on an opening/closing brace
    will search for the corresponding closing/opening brace.  If found in the
    current window, the match will be highlighted.  If a match is found
    outside the window, the line and column number of the match is shown
    in the info window.  By default, brace matching is set to "coding"
    mode, where a match for a closing curly brace stops at the end of the
    current function() definition (which is assumed to be a "}" in column
    one).   If "coding" mode is disabled ("set brace coding off"), a default
    of +/- 100 lines are searched.  Use "set brace range N" to change the
    line limit, (N=0 or "off" to disable).  If the range is 0, the search will
    go to the end of file, or back to start of the file, unless a match is
    found earlier.  The search is forward if the cursor is on an opening brace,
    or backward if the cursor is on a closing brace.

    Options:
	CMD: set bracemode on|off
	CMD: set {}  (shortcut to toggle on/off)
	CMD: set brace range N|off
	CMD: set brace ? shows limit value
	CMD: set brace coding on|off
	CMD: set brace toggle (cycle between modes: coding, limit, off)
	    This last option is used by the -showbuttons {} function.

-   Added the option "-showbuttons" to display clickable buttons
    to run E commands.  For example, clicking on the "redr" button will
    redraw the screen.  The following functions can be executed with a
    mouse click:

	cmd, ins, mark/-mk, +sch/-sch, caps, ccase, spl/join, delC,
	+Win/-W, re, redr, +Pg/-Pg, +L/-L, +wd/-wd, open, close/-cl, pick/put,
	erase/-er, {}, exit.

    Because of the number of buttons, this options looks best in a screensize
    of at least 92 chars.  The option -buttonfont=N [1-255] specifies a
    button background color (the default area highlighting color is used
    if not specified).

    IF YOU ARE NEW TO THE RAND EDITOR, we suggest that you start the editor
    with the "-showbuttons" command-line option, type in some text (you can
    just start typing, the text will be entered into the edit window), and
    then click some of the buttons at the bottom of the screen to see what
    the various commands do.  Typing "<CMD>help<RET>" (CMD is usual Ctrl-A)
    will show a map of the keyboard, and then allow you to type various
    control characters.  The "help" page will show you what editor command
    is tied to that control key. <RET> will return you to the main edit
    window.

-   The "window" command now displays the cursor line as the first line in
    the new window.  Previously, the cursor line plus one was the first line
    in the new window and the cursor line was obscured by the window
    border.  The option -nowinshift reverts to the previous behavior
    starting the new window at cursor line plus one.

-   Added #define NORUNCMD_IN_PROFILE to disallow <cmd>run xxx</ret>
    in the .e_profile

-   Since e19 doesn't support the new options and features of e20, it's useful
    for sites using both versions to have a separate startup file for e20.
    The order in which e20 determines which startup file to use is:

	1.  command line option: -profile=filename
	2.  environment variable EPROFILE20
	3.  environment variable EPROFILE
	4.  ./.e_profile (if safe)
	5.  ~/.e_profile20
	6.  ~/.e_profile

    Neither the EPROFILE20 nor EPROFILE environment variables are needed,
    but they will be used, if present.


-   New keyboard file options to map F1-12 to E commands.
    Examples:

	KEY_F1:<cmd>
	KEY_F2:<redraw>
	KEY_F3:<+page>
	KEY_F4:<-page>
	KEY_F5:<replace>
	KEY_F6:<mouse>
	SHIFT_F1:<+page>
	SHIFT_F2:<-page>
	SHIFT_F3:<caps>
	SHIFT_F4:<ccase>
	SHIFT_F5:<insmd>
	CTRL_F1:<split>
	CTRL_F2:<join>
	CTRL_F3:<mouse>
	CTRL_F4:<close>
	CTRL_F5:<-close>

    Set EKBFILE_NCURSES if using both e20 and e19 (use EKBFILE for e19)

    Note that some terminal emulators use a few function keys for their
    own purposes, eg: gnome-terminal uses F1 for a Help menu, and F11 to
    toggle full screen mode. In gnome-terminal, F1 and F11 can be disabled
    via Edit/Keyboard Shortcuts options.

    On Linux, it appears that the resource "altSendsEscape" is enabled,
    which allows the definition of keyboard file entries like:

	<esc>"o":<open>
	<esc>"p":<pick>

    Using these entries, pressing "ALT-o" will send "<esc>o", which will
    cause the editor to respond as if an "<open>" keypress had been sent.

-   See the examples/ directory for samples of keyboard files and
    .e_profile files.  E20 is compatable with E19 startup and
    keyboard files, but not vice versa.
