Relies on the move and fill routines.

There is supposed to be a limit to the number of characters in an fsd so that
a short can hold that number.  Why did I do this?

Flag to pick and delete to force writing to changes file.

On VMUNIX, parsing should be done with ordinary reads, a buffer should be
alloced to hold the entire file, and vreads should be done for the file.

CMD-DELCHR seems to flush cline after writing out the erased text to the #o
file.

How is the error condition handled where the file the FSD points to has
been deleted and/or ff_closed?

la_verify should look through a table of valid streams, not walk through
from la_firststream, because if one of the streams is corrupted, unpredictable
things can happen.  The table would have to be maintained by la_open and
la_close and be realloced as necessary to grow it.

Chars should not be assumed to be signed in fsd's.
