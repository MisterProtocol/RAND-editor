.SH MACROS
The editor has elementary support for macros.
This support is in the form of a "record/play" capability.
As documented in the section "COMMANDS", the editor supports "record",
"play", and "store" commands.  The command \fI<cmd>record\fR begins
recording editor commands and typed text, until a second \fI<cmd>record\fR
command is given.  The macro that has been recorded may then be replayed
by the command \fI<cmd>play [N]\fR. The optional count \fIN\fR gives the
number of times the macro should be replayed; once is the default.
The macro thus recorded may be assigned
a name by executing \fI<cmd>store [name]\fR. The named macros may
be replayed by the command \fI<cmd>play $name [N]\fR.
