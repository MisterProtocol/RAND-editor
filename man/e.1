.SH SYNOPSIS
.B e
[ options ] [ mainfile [ altfile ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Rand editor
.I E
is a full screen editor which treats a text file as a
two-dimensional surface with text on it.  Among its more
unusual features are manipulating rectangular areas of text,
editing several files at once, and displaying text in one or
more windows.  While it is not as powerful as
.I Emacs,
or as widely used as
.I Vi,
most people at Rand preferred its easy to learn commands and
used it to edit both programs and text, during the period ranging
from roughly 1973 to 1995.
.I E
is a complete rewrite of the Rand
.I NED
editor of many years back.  The current version (E19+) has been
improved to take advantage of terminals that have the ability to
do local insert/delete line, and it can now use
.I termcap
or
.I terminfo
so that most terminals with direct cursor addressing can be used.
.PP
Please note that this manual entry does not try to be either a
tutorial or a full reference manual for the editor.  Rand users
should initially learn
.I E
by reading the RAND document
.I Self Teaching Guide to RAND's Text Processor, 1986,
available from
.I https://rand.org
as N-2056-1.
Report N-2239-1,
.I The RAND Editor e: Version 19, 1986,
is a full reference manual for the editor,
and is mostly correct for this version.
Two other useful reports
are R-2000-ARPA,
.I A Guide to NED: A New On-Line Computer Editor, 1977
and
R-2176-ARPA,
.I The CRT Text Editor NED -- Introduction and Reference Manual, 1977.
.PP
The
.I mainfile
on the command line is the file which is initially displayed
in the editor.  If the file doesn't exist, the user will be asked if
it should be created.  If in addition, an
.I altfile
is specified on the command line, it will be read in as the
initial alternate file.  If no filenames are present on the
command line,
.I e
will attempt to continue from your previous editing session.
To do this it saves "state" in a file called '.es1' in your
current working directory.
Before invoking the editor, be
sure and specify your terminal type by setting the
.SM TERM
environment variable.
.PP
Refer to section
.SM RECENT CHANGES
for a list of new changes to E.

.SH OPTIONS
The currently available command line options are:
.TP
.B \-help
.br
This causes a display of the currently available
options and their values along with the version number
of the editor.
.TP
.BR \-bullets " or " \-nobullets
.br
Options \-bullets and \-nobullets forces border bullets on or off
regardless of line speed or terminal type.  Line speeds of 1200
baud and slower and some terminal types set border bullets off in
the absence of these options.
.TP
.B \-inplace
.br
Option \-inplace preserves file links except for singly\-linked
files.  From within the editor, link preservation can be
turned on and off, even for singly\-linked files, by the update
command.
.TP
.B \-terminal=termtype
.br
Option \-terminal=termtype identifies the terminal type explicitly.
In the absence of the \-terminal option the terminal type is retrieved
from the
.SM TERM
environment variable.
.PP
.RS
If there is no compiled\-in code for the terminal, the termcap entry
for the terminal type will be used and the "standard" keyboard will
be assigned.  Refer to
.SM "TERMINALS SUPPORTED"
section of this document for terminals that can
be supported by compiled\-in code (varies with installation).
.RE
.PP
.B \-keyboard=termtype
.br
.B \-dkeyboard=termtype
.RS
Option \-keyboard=termtype sets the keyboard type to "termtype".  It
overrides any "\-terminal=" argument and also any
.SM EKBD
environment variable.
.RE
.ne 2v
.TP
.B \-dtermcap
.br
Option \-dtermcap forces
.I E
to use the termcap entry for the terminal
identified by the
.SM TERM
variable or \-terminal option, disregarding
any applicable compiled-in code.
.TP
.B \-notracks
.br
Option \-notracks will allow you to edit a file without using or
disturbing the work files (keys, state, and change files) from your
previous session.
.TP
.B \-replay=filename
.br
Option \-replay=filename allows you to replay with a specified keys
file, where "filename" represents that keys file.  Use \-silent when
the replay display is not desired.  The message "***replay
completed" or "***replay aborted" signals the end of the replay.
The
.SM <INT>
key can be used to stop the replay short of completion.
Files .ec1* and .ek1* must not be present if the replay is to
work.
.TP
.B \-norecover
.br
Option \-norecover will open the edit session as defined by the .es1
state file, ignoring any recovery processing of a prior crashed or
aborted session.
.TP
.B \-regexp
.br
Option \-regexp enables regular expression
pattern matching for searching
and replacing.  This mode is also enabled by the "re[gexp]" command.
In regular expression mode, "RE"
is displayed at the bottom of the screen.  The command "\-re[gexp]"
returns to non-regular expression mode.
The regular expressions recognized are
essentially the same as that for \fIed\fR.
.TP
.B \-state=filename
.br
Option \-state=filename causes the initial state of the editor to be
read from the indicated "state" file.  The state file from a previous
\fIE\fR session (with alternate files, windows, cursor positioning,
etc.) may be saved by exiting, and renaming the state file (".es1").
.TP
.B \-[no]stick
.br
Option \-stick sets the behavior at the right margin to stop in response
to text or a <RIGHT\ ARROW>.  \-nostick is the default, and will automatically
shift the window right in response to text or the <RIGHT\ ARROW> key.
.TP
.B \-readonly
.br
Option \-readonly will prohibit any changes to the file(s).
.TP
.B \-noreadonly
.br
Option \-noreadonly will disable the (new e19) mechanism
preventing changes to
files lacking write permission, that you could previously change
because you had write permission in the directory.
.TP
.B \-noprofile
.br
Option \-noprofile will prevent reading of the ".e_profile".
(See \fIcaveat\fR under
.SM STARTUP FILE.
.TP
.B \-profile=file
.br
Specifies the profile to be used in lieu of the default "./.e_profile" or
"~/.e_profile".
See
.SM "STARTUP FILE"
in a later section.
.TP
.B \-blanks
.br
Expands tabs to blanks.  The keyletters
.SM BL
are be displayed at the bottom of the screen.
.TP
.B \-literal
.br
Displays tabs in ^I notation.  The keyletters
.SM LIT
are displayed at the bottom of the screen.
.TP
.B \-tabs
.br
Don't convert tabs to blanks.  The keyletters
.SM TAB
are displayed at the bottom of the screen.
.TP
.B \-nostrip
.br
Do not remove blanks at the end of lines.  The keyletters
.SM NOS
are displayed at the bottom of the screen.
.TP
.B \-nolocks
.br
Turns off file locking if the editor was compiled with the
option
.SM FILELOCKING.
.TP
.B \-search=string
.br
Sets the initial search string.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The
.SM TERM
environment variable defines the terminal type.  Refer to
.SM "TERMINALS SUPPORTED"
for those terminal which
.I e
has terminal specific code compiled in.  If there is no compiled
in code for the terminal
.I e
will look in "/etc/termcap" for
a definition of the terminal.  The \-dtermcap option will force
.I e
to use the "termcap" definition.
.PP
The environment variable
.SM EKBD
defines the keyboad type if different from the
.SM TERM
type.
The
.SM EKBFILE
environment variable points to a keyboard definition file
(see the
.I e19/term
directory in the distribution for examples)
to allow the editor to use keyboard layouts that are not built in.
.PP
The
.SM EDITALT
environment variable will be used as the name
of the alternate file.  If an alternate filename is given on both
the command line and with the
.SM EDITALT
variable, the command line file is used.
The
.SM EPROFILE
environment variable will be used as the name of the "startup" file, in lieu
of "./.e_profile" or "~/.e_profile".  The command line option
\-profile=file wins if both are used.
.PP
The
.SM E_ETCDIR
environment variable overrides the editor's built-in notion of the "etc"
directory (normally
.I /etc/e\c
).  This is useful for installations where management will not allow
the installation of a random user's files into the system's
.I /etc
directory.
This is not generally an issue today, when desktop boxes are unique
to each user.
.SH FILES
.I E
creates and maintains several ".e" files.  They are used
to keep track of the current editing session and can normally
be ignored by the user.  The following information is for the
curious.
.PP
File .es1 contains state information on the last edit session.  It
is created or updated at the end of a normally terminated edit
session.
.PP
File .ec1 indicates the last edit session in this directory
crashed.
.PP
File .ek1 contains a history of the last edit sessions keyboard
inputs.  The .ek1 file is updated at regular intervals so that a
mimimum of work is lost on edit or system crashes.
.PP
File .ek1b is the .ek1 file prior to a recovery replay.
.PP
The presence of any .ek1* file indicates that the last session in
this directory abnormally terminated and that the next edit session
will do recovery processing unless option \-norecover is used.
File .ek1 means abort, .ec1 means crash.
.PP
Note that if the login user is not the owner of the current
directory the above files will be suffixed with the login users
name.  If the user has no write permission in the current
directory, these files are created in the directory /tmp/etmp.
.PP
There are also a few utility files in the directory /etc/e.

support added for Sun2 workstation;
.SH MACROS
The editor has elementary support for macros.
This support is in the form of a "record/play" capability.
As documented in the section "COMMANDS", the editor supports "record",
"play", and "store" commands.  The command \fI<cmd>record\fR begins
recording editor commands and typed text, until a second \fI<cmd>record\fR
command is given.  The macro that has been recorded may then be replayed
by the command \fI<cmd>play [N]\fR. The optional count \fIN\fR gives the
number of times the macro should be replayed; once is the default.
The macro thus recorded may be assigned
a name by executing \fI<cmd>store [name]\fR. The named macros may
be replayed by the command \fI<cmd>play $name [N]\fR. 
.SH COMMANDS
The following commands are available to the user by opening the
command line via the
.SM <CMD>
key and entering the command.  The
entered command is parsed and executed when the
.SM <RETURN>
key is typed.

In the following discussion, pound sign ("#") introduces a comment,
brackets ("[","]") indicate options, and vertical bar ("|")
indicates optional choices.

There are two types of areas: a range of lines (indicated by
<range>) and a marked retangle of text (indicated by <rectangle>).
Some commands will take either type of area, this is indicated by
<area>.
A <range> can be specified either by marking
or by a number followed by "l" for lines or "p" for paragraphs;
rectangular areas must be marked.  The default range is one line
for most commands (fill, adjust and center default to one
paragraph).
.PP

.RS
.PP
All of these commands take the named buffer (one of
adjust, close, erase, pick, run, or box) and add or
merge it into the current file.
.PP
Insert takes the named buffer, moves the existing text
to make room for it, and then inserts it at the
current text location.  It is identical to the \-pick
command, except that now the other named buffers can
also be inserted.
.PP
Cover places the named buffer over top of the text without
moving anything.
.PP
Overlay is like cover, except that only the printing
characters in the buffer clobber the original text.
.PP
Underlay is the reverse of overlay, i.e. the buffer covers
only the non-printing characters of the original text.
.PP
Blot is like overlay except that positions in the file
corresponding to printing characters in the buffer are erased.
.PP
\-blot is like blot except that positions in the file
corresponding to blanks in the buffer are erased.

center  [<range>] width=n
.br
fill    [<range>] width=n
.br
justify [<range>] width=n
.br
.RS
These commands all act upon the range of text and
then replace them with the modified results.  Center
centers the text around the column (width/2), fill
places as many words as possible on each line, and
justify is like fill except that it also provides a
smooth right-margin by embedding blanks.  The old text
is saved in the adjust buffer.  As of e19, fill/just
no longer
filters out CTRL characters, and no longer splits
hyphenated words at the end of a line.  The command
"CMD: set hy" will reinstate splitting.
.RE
.PP

goto [ b | line\-number | e | rb | re ]
.br
Goto is a quick way of moving around a file.  Goto 'b'
moves to the beginning of the file, 'e' moves to the end.
A line-number goes to that line of the file; 'rb' and 're'
move to the beginning or end of a marked range (see the
range command).  A short-cut to goto line-number \fIn\fR
is "CMD: \fIn\fR<RETURN>".

The \-\fIreadonly\fR option is used to enable modifications to
files which (1) you own but lack write permission on,
or, (2) to override a "\-readonly" invocation argument.
.PP
w | window [filename]
.br
\-w | \-window
.br
.RS
The window command will create a new window at the
current cursor position (as long as the cursor
is along the top or left margins).
If a filename is specified, that
file is displayed in the new window, otherwise the
current file is used.  The \-window command deletes
the current window.
.RE
.PP
wp
.br
\-wp
.br
.RS
The \fIwp\fR command enters word procesing mode, \fI\-wp\fR
exits.  A
.SM WP
is displayed at the bottom of the screen in word processing mode.
.SM WP
mode enables power typing or "word wrap", where any text that is
entered past the right margin (see "set rmar" above) is automatically
placed on the following line at the left margin (see "set lmar" above).
.SM WP
mode also moves the cursor to the left margin in response to a <RETURN>.
If
.SM WP
mode is entered while a marked area is in effect, the boundaries of
the marked area become the left and right margin settings.
.RE
.SH FUNCTION KEYS
E supports a set of \fIfunctions\fR that are normally executed by hitting one
of the terminal functions keys, or by typing a specific control- or
escape sequence.  Details of what \fIE-functions\fR are emitted for a specific
terminal's function key layout are hard to document generally, since each
site usually tailor's this to their liking.  Your system administrator should
be able to provide a mapping.  Also, see the following sections
\fIStandard Editior Keyboard\fR and \fITerminals/Keyboards Supported\fR.
Note that some \fIE-functions\fR require first pressing the <CMD> key
followed by another <KEY>.  Refer to the previous section "COMMANDS" for
a discussion of the following functions:
<CLOSE>, <OPEN>, <PICK>, <ERASE>, and <MARK> which
are normally implemented on function keys.  The sequences <CMD><CLOSE>,
<CMD><PICK> and <CMD><ERASE> are documented above as \fI\-close, \-pick, \fRand
\fI\-erase\fR.
.TP .75i
.ie t \{\
. ds UA \(ua
. ds LA \(<-
. ds RA \(->
. ds DA \(da
.\}
.el \{\
. ds UA UP-ARROW
. ds LA LT-ARROW
. ds RA RT-ARROW
. ds DA DN-ARROW
.\}
<\*(LA> | <\*(UA> | <\*(DA> | <\*(RA>
The arrow keys move one space (or line) in the indicated direction.  An <\*(UA> on
the top line of the window (or <\*(DA> on the bottom line) scrolls the window
down (or up) one line.  A <\*(LA> at the left edge of a window does nothing.
A <\*(RA> at the right edge of a window does nothing if option \%\-\fIstick\fR
is set, otherwise the window is shifted right (16 spaces by default).
.TP
<+LINE>, <+LINE>
scrolls window down/up about 1/4 the window size.
.TP
<CMD><+LINE>, <CMD><\-LINE>
makes the current
cursor line the top (or bottom) line of the window.
.TP
<+PAGE>, <\-PAGE>
scrolls window down/up a full "page".
.TP
<CMD><+PAGE>, <CMD><\-PAGE>
moves to the end/beginning of the file.
.TP
<+SRCH>, <\-SRCH>
searches in the indicated direction for the next occurrence of the "search string".
The \fIsearch string\fR is set by <CMD>\|search string\|\c
.ie t <\(+-SRCH>.
.el <+/-SRCH>.
.TP
<CMD><+SRCH>, <CMD><\-SRCH>
sets the "search string" to the current cursor word, and performs a search
in the indicated direction.
.TP
<+TAB>, <\-TAB>
tabs in indicated direction.
.TP
<+WORD>, <\-WORD>
moves to next/previous word.
.TP
<ALT>
switch to alternate file, also "<CMD>e<RETURN>".
.TP
<BS>
backspace, moves left and erases previous character.
<CMD><BS>
deletes text from the beginning of the line up to the current cursor character.
In \fIinsert mode\fR, the rest of the line is moved left.
.ne 3v
.TP
<CHWIN>
change to next window.
.ne 2v
.TP
<CTRLCHAR>
used to enter non-ascii characters (\e000\-\e037) in text.
.TP
<DELCHAR>
deletes cursor character.
.TP
<CMD><DELCHAR>
deletes text from the cursor to the end of the line.
.TP
<HOME>
moves to upper left corner of window.
.TP
<INSERT>
toggles \fIinsert\fR mode.
.TP
<INT>
Interrupts the operation of various functions: e.g., searches.
.TP
<MARK>
used to define a range of lines or rectangular area of text.  A simple
<MARK> will start by defining one \fIline\fR.  Moving the cursor up/down will
extend the defined range of \fIlines\fR (as will other keys like <+LINE>
<+PAGE>).  When full lines are \fImarked\fR, the message "MARK \fIn\fR" is displayed
at the bottom of the screen.  Rectangular areas of text are marked by first
marking one or more lines, then moving the cursor left or right.  When a
rectangular area is marked, the message "MARK \|\fIlines\fR\|x\|\fIcols\fR" is
displayed.
.TP
<CMD><MARK>
cancels any mark in affect.
.TP
<REPL>
Executes the "replacement" while doing an interactive replace command.
.TP
<RETURN>
Positions cursor at column 1 on the next line.  A <RETURN> on the bottom line
of a window is equivalent to a <+LINE>.  In WP mode, a <RETURN> positions the
cursor at the current \fIleft margin\fR on the next line, which may automatically
shift the window left.
.TP
<WINLEFT>, <WINRIGHT>
Shifts the window left/right (16 spaces by default).
.TP
<CMD><WINLEFT>
Shifts the window all the way back to column 1.
.TP
<CMD><WINRIGHT>
Shifts the window as far right as necessary to display the end of the line.

.SH STANDARD EDITOR KEYBOARD
.PP
There is now a "standard" E keyboard, that is designed to be usable
on all video display terminals.  Either say "e \-keyboard=standard" or
"setenv
.SM EKBD
standard" before running E to select this keyboard.
This is also the keyboard that E will use if there is no specific knowledge
of your type of terminal compiled into the editor.
.PP
This keyboard layout is designed to be used on terminals with no
function keys. "^H" means control\-H, and "^X\-^U" means control\-X
followed by control\-U.  The ALT entry gives you a choice of "^/"
or "^_" because one or the other or both will not work on some
terminals. ("_" is correct ASCII.)

.sp
This is installation specific information with the actual terminal
types defined varying across the host cpu's versions of the editor.
Now that the editor can be driven from termcap and the standard
keyboard, many sites will wish to delete specific terminal type
support to save memory.  (N.b: These days, the amount of memory thus
saved is several orders of magnitude less than anybody would conceivably
be worried about). Code is provided with E for the
following terminals and may be compiled into your version.
.PP
Also, note that the
.SM EKBFILE
environment variable may be used to redefine the keyboard at will
on an individual user basis.

.SH PLATFORMS SUPPORTED
.sp
This version of the editor has been ported to, and tested on,
Linux systems (specifically CentOS) and Mac systems (specifically
Mojave and Catalina).
It is not a "clickable" app; it must be run in a terminal window.
.PP
The Linux version has been run under the Linux subsystem (specifically
Ubuntu) on Windows 10,
but has not been extensively tested there.  Or, really, tested at all.
.PP
To build the distribution on a given platform, read the
.SM README.md
file in the GitHub distribution.
In brief, look in the top-level Makefile file
to find the target for your platform ("sys5" for Linux, "bsd" for Mac).
Then, read the e19/Makefile file to see what reconfiguration must be
done to build your target.
"e" was built long, long before the
.I config
utility was developed.
.SH STARTUP FILE
.sp
As a means of individually tailoring various options on startup, E will
run commands specified in a "profile" file.  The order in which E
decides which "profile" file to run, is:  command line option
\-profile=\fIfile\fR,
environment variable
.SM EPROFILE,
a "safe" ./.\fIe_profile\fR,
and if none of these exist, ~/.\fIe_profile\fR.
("./.e_profile" is deemed to be safe if you are not the super-user, you own
the file, and it's not writable by everyone else.)
If the first line of the profile file begins with the keyword "options:",
then the rest of the line is treated as if typed as initial arguments
to E.  The options must currently all be on one line.
.sp
Profile format notes:
.bu
blank lines and lines beginning with # are ignored
.bu
E function keys are denoted by "<keyword>";  use "\e<" to insert a "<" in text;
"<#keyword>" may be used to repeat \fIkeyword\fR #-times
.bu
keywords:
.nf
.ta .5i 1.5i 2.5i 3.5i
.ds t \t
\*t<+line> \*t<bksp>  \*t<home>     \*t<right>*
\*t<+page> \*t<cchar> \*t<insmd>    \*t<split>
\*t<+sch>  \*t<chwin> \*t<int>      \*t<srtab>
\*t<+tab>  \*t<close> \*t<join>     \*t<tab>
\*t<+word> \*t<cmd>   \*t<left>*    \*t<up>*
\*t<\-line>\*t<dchar> \*t<mark>     \*t<wleft>
\*t<\-page>\*t<down>* \*t<open>     \*t<wright>
\*t<\-sch> \*t<dword> \*t<pick>     \*t<null>
\*t<\-tab> \*t<edit>  \*t<replace>  \*t<undef>
\*t<\-word>\*t<erase> \*t<ret>
.sp 2p
\*t(*=cursor motion)
.fi
.bu
essentially anything that can be typed at E can be inserted in the
".e_profile".  Thus, application specific editor scripts can be created.
.bu
note that various
.SM CMD
options end with a <ret>, others don't; e.g., "<cmd>tabs 4<ret>", but
"<cmd><+page>".
.bu
E looks for a "profile" file and
examines the "options:" line \fIbefore\fR processing any command line arguments,
thus command line options override any options specified in the
"options:" line.  \fICaveat\fR: if the \-profile=file argument is used, any
"options:" in a profile file will have already been processed.  This is
a "cart before the horse" problem....
.bu
any format errors will terminate reading of the profile file, and continue
the E session;
.ne 4v
.bu
example:
.nf
.RS
options: \-regex \-stick
<cmd>tabs 4<ret>
<cmd>set window 40<ret>
.RE
.fi
.SH BUGS
.sp
By far the worst problem with E is its treatment of tabs.
E is a "whitespace" editor, all whitespace is considered
equal.  On any line that E modifies, it will compress
multiple initial blanks to tabs, strip trailing blanks,
and convert any embedded tabs to blanks.  This is acceptable
for most editing, but some programs expect real tab characters
as input, for example tbl(1) and some nroff commands.  However,
the new options \fB\-lit, \-nostrip, \-tabs\fR, and \fB\-blanks\fR
alleviate most of these problems.
.sp
Resizing terminal windows in the parent operating system is not supported.
