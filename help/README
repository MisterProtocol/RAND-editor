Files in this directory:

	kl.???? - keyboard left displays, configured for standard display.
	kr.???? - same, but right half.
	helpkey - text messages describing keystroke functions, used
		by morehelp() in e.h.c.
	print???? - a printable display of a keyboard.
	dk - a program that displays a keyboard file directly.
	Crashdoc, recovermsg, errmsg - error handling text files (belong
		in /etc/e).

The k?.* files contain the display keyboards, with standard encodings for
line-drawing and enhanced-mode.  These are a bit difficult to create, but
well worth the effort (anyone thirsting for a medium-small programming
job?  Build an editor to do that :-)).  There are four control characters
embedded within the files:

	Ctrl-N = enter line-drawing mode. The following characters (up
		to the next crtl-O) are in the range E through O, or
		blanks. The characters represent line-drawing characters
		as follows:

			E - upper left corner   F - upper right corner
			G - lower left corner   H - lower right corner
			I - cross               J - vertical line
			K - horizontal line     L - left join
			M - right join          N - bottom join
			O - top join

	Ctrl-O = exit from line drawing mode.
	Ctrl-P = Enter enhanced mode. Enhance the following characters
		until ctrl-Q is encountered. Enhancement may be bold or
		reversed video, depending on the terminal used.
	Ctrl-Q = Exit enhanced mode.
