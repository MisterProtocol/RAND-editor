The last time you used the editor in this directory, you crashed or aborted.
You have these choices:

  1. E will replay the last session on the screen;  you should exit before
     you continue editing.
       (Normally, select this option.)

  2. If E continues to crash in response to Option 1, you can specify
     this option followed by the number of characters to stop replaying
     before the end of the keystroke file.  For example, "2 10" would stop
     the replay 10 characters before the end.  If you enter "2 ?", E will
     read the keystroke file and show you options for how many characters
     to specify, and then return you to the shell.

  3. E will ignore the crashed or aborted session and forge ahead as per the
     arguments with which it was invoked.
       (Select this option only if you do NOT wish to recover the last
       session's work.)

  4. E will return you to the shell, having done nothing.
       (Select this option if you do not know what to do and need assistance
       from your system administrators.)
