Termcap change: terminals that have the "nc"
`feature' should now work with E.

--------
It used to be possible to generate lines with trailing tabs. No more.

-------

BUGS:
-----
On systems without exclusive open, some other sort of interlocking method
  should be attempted, to determine if multiple users are working in the
  same directory

No allocs should take place from the time that the user issues the "exit"
  command until E exits, because if an out-of-heapspace occurs during that
  time you're screwed.

Line number should be updated on a replace with the show option.

Command line doesn't get flushed out during replay of replace commands.

Fix what happens when command line too long.

Should catch attempted replaces that will loop.

Still, if you hold down the <CLOSE> key until all lines are closed,
you can be left with lines on the screen.

Fixed:
------

window comand writes first line of new window on CMD line
  if alt window cursor was on first line.
(fixed 6/11/81)

2/7/81 <CMD><DELCHR> seems to pick up a lot of spaces after the end
of the line, which you notice when you go to put the erase buffer.

If a -update comand has been issued for a file, a 'save' command is
a no-op, and you are not told.

Close rectangle doesn't work if CCHAR appears in the text.

Blot-@'s can remain on the screen image after a ^B; redraw doesn't help.
