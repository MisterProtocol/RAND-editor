Installation instructions:

1.  In ./include, install the appropriate "localenv.h" and "c_env.h".

    For solaris:        ln -s local.linux localenv.h

    For solaris:        ln -s local.solaris localenv.h

    For bsd/sunos4.1.x: ln -s local.bsdsun localenv.h

    c_env.h is the same for solaris and bsd on Sparc.

    (b) if compiling for solaris of sysV, set S5DEFINES as described in
    Makefile.
